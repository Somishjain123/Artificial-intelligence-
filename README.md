# My AI Projects Portfolio

This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of my projects and assignments from my Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning coursework. The projects are designed to demonstrate my skills in data analysis, model building, and the practical application of AI to solve real-world problems.

### **Repository Structure**

Each project is organized into its own folder, containing all relevant files, code, and a detailed project report or `README.md` to explain its purpose and findings.

- **`Traffic-Accident-Hotspot-Prediction`**: An analysis of road accident data to predict high-risk zones using clustering and classification models.
- **`[Project Name 2]`**: [A brief, one-sentence description of your next project.]
- **`[Project Name 3]`**: [A brief, one-sentence description of your third project.]
- **`[Project Name 4]`**: [A brief, one-sentence description of your fourth project.]
- **`[Project Name 5]`**: [A brief, one-sentence description of your fifth project.]

### **Skills Highlighted**

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Experience with a range of models including **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, **XGBoost**, and **K-Means Clustering**.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Proficiency in using tools to analyze datasets, extract insights, and visualize findings.
- **Problem Solving**: The ability to apply AI techniques to address practical challenges, from urban planning to resource optimization.
- **Documentation**: Skills in creating clear, professional reports that explain methodologies, results, and business value.
- **Python**: Implementation of algorithms and analysis using Python.

This portfolio is a reflection of my journey in AI, showcasing both my theoretical knowledge and my hands-on ability to build intelligent systems.
